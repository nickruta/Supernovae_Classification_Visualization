# Supernovae Classification Visualization Project

A supernovae (SN) is the explosion of a massive star at the end of its evolutionary life. This explotion produces a huge amount of light making even far away stars visible by us through a relatively short period of time. Astronomers have classified SNe in terms of their light curves and spectral absortion lines.

This d3 javascript visualization allows us to see the types of the top two classes, the probability that the observation belongs to each type and the confidence, or tension as defined in the provided presentation slides, of the predictions for a given probabilistic model.
